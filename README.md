# MES Certification Navigator

Makes the [CMS MES Certification Repository](https://github.com/CMSgov/CMCS-DSG-DSS-Certification) —
the source of truth for Streamlined Modular Certification outcomes and metrics — searchable and
crosswalked. Built by [Provenance Advisors](https://provenanceadvisorsllc.com).

Unofficial. Not affiliated with or endorsed by CMS.

## What it indexes

| | Count |
|---|---|
| CMS-required outcomes | 141 across 13 modules |
| CMS-approved state-specific examples | 58 |
| Conditions for Enhanced Funding | 22 |
| CFR citations (Title 42 and 45), linked to eCFR | 124 |
| CMS guidance pages | 6 |

Three further modules (HIE, AVS, 1115/Waiver) certify against state-specific outcomes only. EVV's
9 CMS-required outcomes are published as a table in its module readme rather than a `_data/*.csv`
like the other 13 — the ETL reads both.

## Data pipeline

`npm run build` runs `scripts/prepare-data.mjs` before `next build`. That clones the CMS repository,
runs the ETL in `scripts/etl.mjs`, and writes `src/data/*.json` plus the guidance images into
`public/`.

Content is **pinned** to a reviewed CMS commit so builds are reproducible and CMS cannot change
the site's content between deploys. The pin is not a constant in the build script — it is
`sourceCommit` in `data-snapshot/meta.json`, the commit that produced the committed data. One
source of truth: the pin and the data it generated cannot drift apart. The build log reports which
commit it used, where the pin came from, and whether it applied:

```
Cert repo at commit c9db9cd… (pinned: c9db9cd… from data-snapshot/meta.json)
```

The pin moves weekly, not never. `.github/workflows/cms-sync.yml` runs every Monday, asks CMS what
`HEAD` is, and — when it differs from the pin — rebuilds against it, runs the full CI suite (lint,
typecheck, build, data invariants, link check), and opens a PR carrying the new data plus a summary
of what changed: count deltas per dataset, and the outcomes, CEFs, citations, and guidance pages
added, removed, or reworded. Removals are flagged first, since the ETL's floors tolerate a partial
loss. Merging that PR advances the pin, because every build rewrites `data-snapshot/meta.json` with
the commit it used. Nothing deploys until a human merges.

`node scripts/summarize-sync.mjs` prints that same summary locally after any build — it compares the
committed snapshot against the freshly built `src/data/`.

To build against something other than the pin, set `CERT_REPO_REF` to a commit, tag, or branch;
`CERT_REPO_REF=HEAD` tracks the latest CMS content. If the pin cannot be read and no `CERT_REPO_REF`
is set, the build fails rather than quietly tracking whatever CMS has today. Note that reusing an
existing clone via `CERT_REPO_DIR` skips checkout and therefore bypasses the pin — the build warns
loudly and logs `(PIN NOT APPLIED)` when that happens.

The ETL fails the build rather than shipping a hole: a missing CMS-required CSV throws, and sanity
assertions enforce floors on every count. If the clone itself fails, the committed `data-snapshot/`
is used as a fallback with a loud warning — that path skips the ETL, which is why the generated data
and `public/SMC Process/` images are committed rather than gitignored.

Citation parsing lives only in `scripts/etl.mjs`. The UI consumes precomputed link segments; it does
not re-parse citations. Keep it that way — two copies of that regex previously drifted apart.

### eCFR link normalization

eCFR routes only `/current/title-N/section-X.Y` and `/current/title-N/part-N`. Raw CMS cites are
normalized onto those:

| Cite shape | Resolves to |
|---|---|
| `42 CFR 433.138(d)` | `section-433.138#p-433.138(d)` |
| `42 CFR 435.940-965` | `section-435.940` (first in range) |
| `42 CFR 438` | `part-438` |
| `42 CFR 431.052` | `section-431.52` — CMS zero-pads two cites that don't exist that way in the CFR |

Where a cite is normalized, the discrepancy is shown on the page rather than silently corrected.

## Environment

| Var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ASSISTANT_LIVE` | `1` enables live drafting. Required — a credential alone never exposes the endpoint. |
| `MODEL_API_KEY` | Credential for the model endpoint. |
| `MODEL_ID` | Model identifier, exactly as your provider names it. No default. |
| `MODEL_BASE_URL` | Endpoint origin serving the Messages API shape (default `https://api.anthropic.com`). Point it at your own provider or boundary. |
| `ASSISTANT_ACCESS_CODE` | If set, the assistant requires this code. Set it before any public deployment that also has an API key. |
| `CERT_REPO_REF` | Build against a CMS commit/tag/branch other than the pin in `data-snapshot/meta.json`. `HEAD` tracks latest. Not sensitive — a public commit in a public repo. |
| `CERT_REPO_DIR` | Reuse an existing local clone instead of cloning. Bypasses the pin; the build warns when it does. |

The assistant's per-IP rate limit is in-memory, so it is per serverless instance and not a global
cap. A public deployment with an API key needs `ASSISTANT_ACCESS_CODE` **and** a provider spend cap.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run build   # required first — generates src/data/ that the app imports
npm run dev
```

## Licensing

The MIT license in this repository covers the application code only.

Content under `src/data/`, `data-snapshot/`, and `public/SMC Process/` is derived from the CMS MES
Certification Repository, a publicly published U.S. government work. CMS has not asserted a license
on it (their `LICENSE.md` reads "FIXME: This is probably in the public domain, but CMMS needs to put
their license here"), so it is attributed rather than relicensed, and the MIT grant here should not
be read as extending to it.
